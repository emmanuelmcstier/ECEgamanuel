            <h1>Online Money Making Methods</h1><br><br>
            <h1>Affiliate Marketing</h1>
            <p>
                one of the greatest ways of making money online or in real life is providing services and products of
                your own to
                customers
                and it is clear if you are beginner and want to make money easily and quickly you are not gonna have the
                time or the
                chance
                to do that,we wanna make one thing clear here there is no such thing as get rich quick because providing
                your own
                service and procucts will require you to develop some skill with which you can
                make or provide something valuabe that people are willing to pay for.and this may be frustrating right
                from the start if
                you don't know what you're doing, lucky for us, here is where Affiliate Marketing checks in, Affiliate
                marketing is when
                other third-party entity provide the service or manufacture the product but you just gonna need to
                promote or sell
                products or find client
                for the service and get a percentage commission.

                Click Bank
                one of the biggest platform when it comes to affiliate program and promoting other people's product is
                click bank
                platform
                and in addition click bank is one the of those platforms that you get high amount of comssion compared
                to other
                platforms
                ,up to 90% of product you sell.</p>
            <h1>3 Steps To Become High Ticket Affiliate Marketer</h1>

            <p>1,Find a profitable system.
                the first thing you need to do is focus on finding a profitable system or HTAM product that is proven to
                bring
                in sales.finding profitable system specially for beginners who want to make money online might seem a
                bit
                unecessary
                and very tedious work, but actually that is a key to success, yep you can make 1.90$ commission
                promoting a
                7$, and
                that is kinda okay for beginners but,we can take this stuff a step further by just choosing a profitable
                product and
                promoting it to target audience or traffic source,speaking of traffic source, it is the next step of
                this
                journey.</p>

            <p>2,Pick a traffic Source
                This is the one of the most important stuff.finding organic traffic to the product you're promoting can
                be
                quite
                challenging when you're just starter. yep, as starter you can use platforms comments,forum
                comments,SEO,etc
                to reach out
                to your target audience, but we highly recommend not to use this free traffic source since we are
                talking
                about HTAM.
                we are not saying they won't work, but they require more time and alota effort.pick a traffic source
                that
                you personally
                belive you can do.

                *if you are really good at videos,then you can pick youtube.youtube is goldmine if you know how to
                really
                leverage it,it goes without saying eveyone knows, people make millions of money through the ads that are
                being shown on
                creater's videos,and if you choose youtube,you can kill two bird with one stone.because you can make
                money
                through
                google
                adsense and on the other, let's not forget about what we are talking about, you are promoting products
                through youtube
                videos, which you will end up getting even more traffic to the product you're promoting, obviously
                through
                the affiliate
                link you provide in the description of your video.
            <p>*then again if you are good at writing, pick facebook.facebook is a market place if you exactly know
                what
                you're
                doing. as matter of fact facebook has a service called facebook market place. to be honest you can
                use
                any social
                media like instagram or twitter to promote the products.you can also use SEO or any leveragable methods
                like
                blog to
                promote your product</p>

            *Back to paid traffic,Working on paid traffic is much quicker and depandable.both youtube and
            facebook
            also instagram
            advertisment programs,as matter of fact this is how this big companies make their money, but paid
            traffic on
            this
            site is kinda expensive, particularly facebook ads and instagram ads(actually they are the same
            company).
            youtube ad is, as we believe a little profitable,because alota people fear youtube ad, they think only
            big
            companies
            Uber and whatnot are the only afforders. but that is not true.individual's can also advertise on
            youtube.</p>


            <p>3, Build your list and provide value to your list
                we can't stress enough how important it is to build your own list.all top affilites are successful
                because
                of this
                simple step.when we say build a list it might be a little tricky for beginners, a list or your email
                list is
                acutally
                the list of people or their email,that you gather to later reache out to them with some values and the
                product
                you gonna be promoting.to do this you need an email auto responder service, which most are not free. we
                have
                a free auto
                responder
                for you...</p>
